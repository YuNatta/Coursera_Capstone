            "source": "I work for a prospective investor in the Melbourne real estate market.  The client's view is to attain a foothold in the Melbourne market before the predicted upswing in the next six to twelve months.  The property must be within client's ability to service the loan.  Based on client's approach to a bank, they will lend up to 410k-550k AUD on a property.\n\n**Restrictions** \nAfter conducting research of bank lending practices, even though APRA have lifted recently introduced tougher restrictions on bank lending to investors, banks are still hesitant to lend willingly beyond a Loan-to-Value ratio (LVR) of more than 70%. This means that banks are still only willing to lend 70% of the bank valuation of a property for investment purposes (instead of the 90% pre-restrictions). This is due to the banks wanting to restrict their exposure to poor market conditions and not willing to hold high quantities of security in stock due to the glut of new apartments released into the market, especially in high rise developments. This is the reason many major banks including AMP, Macquarie and NAB will not lend (or severely restrict lending) to real estate \u201cblacklisted\u201d postcode. Typically these will be in or very close to the Melbourne CBD due to the high density of apartments. \n\n**Market Outlook** \nThis is dependent on who is making the prediction but the majority of forecasters are predicting six to 12 months before the upswing genuinely occurs. Even at the moment with auction clearance rates now at 76%, market signs indicate that in some areas and property types the market is bottoming out and the upswing may already be happening. \nAnother factor to consider is the area with many commentators predicting the areas of high demand being the south-east of the city within a 22km radius. This is due to the abundance of good schools (public and private), infrastructure spending, gentrification of older suburbs, good transport links and proximity to beaches and public spaces, but not being too far for a city commute. \n\n**Interested Audience:** I believe this is an interesting and usufull challenge with valid questions for anyone who considered to make an investment in large cities in Australia, Canada, US, EU, Asia, etc. The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.",
